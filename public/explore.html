        <h1>History Of India</h1>
        <h3>India’s history can be broken down into three major phases. The first phase is the ancient period known as Ancient India, which covers thousands of years that began when humans first settled in India. This period includes the Indus Valley Civilization (c. 3300-1300 BCE), which is considered one of the world’s oldest civilizations and a precursor to modern Indian culture.

            In medieval India, a period in Indian history is seen as lasting from the ancient period to the Mughal Empire. This long span of time begins in the 6th century AD and ends in 1526 when the empire was established. Some historians believe that it started later than these dates and ended earlier.
            
            In the early 20th century, India was also experiencing a period of change. In 1857, the Indian independence movement began in Bengal with the first nationalistic revolutionary movement. The British Empire controlled India at this time and it lasted until 1947 when India gained its independence.</h3>
